<p>I took a <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/raft.html">course</a> recently with some work peers that was focused on recreating the RAFT consensus algorithm from scratch.</p>

<p>The course itself was taught by David Beazley, a professor at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>The entire idea of the course was to fully recreate RAFT from scratch using nothing but the OS libraries included in a standard bundle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sockets</li>
  <li>Threading</li>
  <li>Queueing</li>
</ul>

<p>The main challenge, other than recreating this thing from scratch, was creating a fully functioning test suite along with trying to have some sort of production setting with DNS and networking.</p>
