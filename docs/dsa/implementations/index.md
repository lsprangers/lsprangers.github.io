# Data Structure Implementations
These are all just specific examples of things I've seen, or given, in interviews that are a bit more involved than Leetcode

## In Memory Implementations
Some of the other implementations that sit under reusable resources:
- [In Memory KV Store With Transactions](/docs/architecture_components/typical_reusable_resources/typical_distributed_kv_store/kv_store_with_transactions.md)
- [In Memory Rate Limiter](/docs/architecture_components/typical_reusable_resources/typical_rate_limiter/rate_limiter.md)
- [In Memory File / BLOB Store](/docs/architecture_components/typical_reusable_resources/typical_distributed_kv_store/kv_store_with_transactions.md)
