## Binary Search

$O(\log n)$ lookup on sorted array!

The entirety of binary search is around being able to find something in $O(\log n)$ time because our data structure is sorted in some way - whether it's a Tree, a List, or the number line (integers)

At each step of the way we shrink the search space by half because we know the data structure is sorted in some way - if we were looking for a word in the dictionary that starts with D and we randomly flipped to the letters N, we'd look to the left

Most of the time, BSearch is "faster" because it will beat out $O(n^2)$

Why is it $\log(n)$? Mostly because if there are $n$ elements, and we are constantly splitting it in half, we'll do at most $\log(n)$ searches
$\log(n) = x \rarr 2^x = n$ 

I guess that's just repeating the same thing twice - here's a photo:

### Typical Problem Statements
Some will outright say "find this value in a sorted list" which makes things easy, most won't
Other ways to describe it"
- Theres an array of times each train takes
- Array of times it takes to eat a meal
- Given a threshold k, whatâ€™s the minimum time each train / meal would take to finish
- Find an element in an array that's been sorted, and then rotated
- Capacity to ship packages within $D$ days (f' this one)
    - [Solution](/docs/leetcode/python/capacityToShipPackagesWithinDDays.md)

Most of these solutions will involve a `check()` function, where you will propose some item in the search space, like an index or other value, and then quickly check if that value works

For the capacity to ship packages problem, the `check()` function revolves around checking if the weight capacity can cover the shipping requirements - the `check()` funciton itself runs in $O(n)$ time so it seems slow, but ultimately it's still fast compared to other routes

The reason this is "fast" is that in $O(\log(n))$ time we can propose capacity values, and then for each of them it takes $O(n)$ time to check so the overall solution is $O(n \cdot \log(n))$. This is faster than iterating from 1 to 2 to 3... capacity which would result in $O(n^2)$

## Typical Patterns And Pitfalls
There are some typical patterns pitfalls that annoyingly come up in almost every review, and using them correctly is very important!

The main questions to ask yourself:
- What is the search space?
- What does check(mid) mean?
- What is the goal (min valid, max valid, exact match)?
    - This will alter what we return
- When is mid good/bad? Adjust low/high accordingly
    - This will alter our `low = ` and `high =` updates
- Do you return low, high, or mid?

| Goal / Pattern                              | `mid` Calc                          | `low` Update                       | `high` Update                      | Loop Condition      | Return  | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search on value / exact match**           | `(low + high) // 2`                  | `low = mid + 1`                      | `high = mid - 1`                     | `while low <= high` | index or -1 | Classic binary search                                                 |
| **Find first `x` such that condition(x)**   | `(low + high) // 2` (**bias left**)  | `low = mid + 1` if false             | `high = mid` if true                 | `while low < high`  | `low`   | **Lower bound** - shrink right side when mid is valid                 |
| **Find last `x` such that condition(x)**    | `(low + high + 1) // 2` (**bias right**) | `low = mid` if true                  | `high = mid - 1` if false            | `while low < high`  | `low`   | **Upper bound** - shrink left side when mid is invalid; bias prevents infinite loop |



### Classic Binary Search
This will find the first exact match, and only returns `mid` if it finds it

`mid + 1` because we just checked mid, and we know it's not involved, `mid - 1` because of the same logic

```python
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1
```

#### Example 1: Even Number of Elements

Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]  
Target: 8

| Step | low | high | mid | arr[mid] | Comparison | Action               |
|------|-----|------|-----|----------|------------|----------------------|
| 1    | 0   | 5    | 2   | 6        | 6 < 8      | low = mid + 1 (=3)   |
| 2    | 3   | 5    | 4   | 10       | 10 > 8     | high = mid - 1 (=3)  |
| 3    | 3   | 3    | 3   | 8        | 8 == 8     | return mid (=3)      |


#### Example 2: Odd Number of Elements

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]  
Target: 5

| Step | low | high | mid | arr[mid] | Comparison | Action           |
|------|-----|------|-----|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1    | 0   | 4    | 2   | 5        | 5 == 5     | return mid (=2)  |



### Lower Bound (First Valid X)
For lower bound we strive to find the first element that satisfies some condition like $\leq$ target or $\ge$ target

In these ones, we now must figure out which condition to not decrement, such as `high = mid`, because in this scenario `mid` may have the correct answer at some point, and we need to reduce search space to left to see if there's another one beforehand

```python
while low < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if condition(mid):  # go left
        high = mid
    else:               # go right
        low = mid + 1
return low
```

#### Example: Find First Element $\ge$ Target

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]  
Target: 6  
Goal: Find the first index where arr[i] $\ge$ 6

| Step | low | high | mid | arr[mid] | arr[mid] $\ge$ 6? | Action             |
|------|-----|------|-----|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 0   | 5    | 2   | 5        | No            | low = mid + 1 (=3) |
| 2    | 3   | 5    | 4   | 9        | Yes           | high = mid (=4)    |
| 3    | 3   | 4    | 3   | 7        | Yes           | high = mid (=3)    |
| 4    | 3   | 3    | -   | -        | -             | End, return low=3  |

Result: Returns index 3 (arr[3]=7), which is the first element $\ge$ 6.

---

#### Edge Case: All Elements Less Than Target

Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Target: 10  
Goal: Find the first index where arr[i] $\ge$ 10

| Step | low | high | mid | arr[mid] | arr[mid] $\ge$ 10? | Action             |
|------|-----|------|-----|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 0   | 4    | 2   | 3        | No             | low = mid + 1 (=3) |
| 2    | 3   | 4    | 3   | 4        | No             | low = mid + 1 (=4) |
| 3    | 4   | 4    | 4   | 5        | No             | low = mid + 1 (=5) |
| 4    | 5   | 4    | -   | -        | -              | End, return low=5  |

Result: Returns index 5 (out of bounds), meaning no element $\ge$ 10 exists.

---

#### Edge Case: First Element Satisfies Condition

Array: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Target: 2  
Goal: Find the first index where arr[i] $\ge$ 2

| Step | low | high | mid | arr[mid] | arr[mid] $\ge$ 2? | Action             |
|------|-----|------|-----|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 0   | 4    | 2   | 4        | Yes           | high = mid (=2)    |
| 2    | 0   | 2    | 1   | 3        | Yes           | high = mid (=1)    |
| 3    | 0   | 1    | 0   | 2        | Yes           | high = mid (=0)    |
| 4    | 0   | 0    | -   | -        | -             | End, return low=0  |

Result: Returns index 0 (arr[0]=2), which is the first element $\ge$ 2.

### Upper Bound (Last Valid X)
This is the flip scenario of [Lower Bound](#lower-bound-first-valid-x), and so in this scenario we set `low = mid` and `high = mid - 1` 

This is because there can be multiple `mid` that satisfy the result, but we want to find the last one so we keep shrinking / dragging search space to the right

mid calculation being `low + high + 1` also ***prevents an infinite loop, and is vital***

```python
while low < high:
    mid = (low + high + 1) // 2  # Bias right
    if condition(mid):  # go right
        low = mid
    else:               # go left
        high = mid - 1
return low
```

### Search On Answer
Search On Answer problems usually mean changing the search space, and then finding the [Lower Bound](#lower-bound-first-valid-x) or [Upper Bound](#upper-bound-last-valid-x) based on problem statement

```python
low = max(weights)
high = sum(weights)

while low < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if can_ship_in_days(mid):
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid + 1
return low
```


### What To Define
For any BS problem:
- What is the search space?
- What does check(mid) mean?
- What is the goal (min valid, max valid, exact match)?
- When is mid good/bad? Adjust low/high accordingly.
- Do you return low, high, or mid?

### Answer Space
The discussion in [Capacity To Ship Packages](/docs/leetcode/python/capacityToShipPackagesWithinDDays.md) showcases the need to rigorously define answer spaces in the correct way

If we are checking potential answers outside of this space, they may return false positives / negatives that would ruin our entire check!

## ATypical
There are some weird ones thrown in as well, especially rotating lists, a weird search space, or "guessing" at a condition

### Rotating Lists
Problem Statement:
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

    `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.
    `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`

In these scenarios, the `condition(mid)` function needs to change to figure out if we should go left or right

If an array isn't sorted, then we know for sure last element at end $\geq$ first element at 0

However, if an array is rotated, then the last element would be smaller than the first element - seeing this pattern we can realize there's a place, an ***Inflection Point*** where we can figure out where the real start was

Therefore, what we need to search for is an index $i : i > i + 1$ which would correspond to the old start and end

![Inflection Point](/img/inflection_point.png)

Therefore, `check` becomes:
```
mid = low + high // 2
if check(mid):
    return(mid)
elif mid > first element of array:
    search to the right
else:
    search to the left
```
because if we find the number 6, which is above the first element 4, we know our inflection point is still to the right of us

### Find A Rate
There are some specific problems like [KoKo Eating Bananas](/docs/leetcode/python/kokoEatingBananas.md) and Elves on Package Line where you basically need to find a rate of something, and then check if that rate suffices

Koko's eating rate, maybe it's 3 bananas-per-hour, and if that works then we'd look if a higher rate would suffice like 10-per-hour, etc...

Usually this would mean the rate finding is $O(\log R)$ where $R$ is the rate search space, and then there'd be an input array of size $N$ that we must check through. The check function is typically $O(N)$ so in total it's $(O\log R \cdot N)$ versus $O(R \cdot N)$

Otherwise, you just continuously check the rate instead of "smart searching" using binary search

## Structures
Lists and Tree's are typically the data structures that we see with Binary Search

### Lists
There's some gotchas for list, mostly around defining high and low, and different $\le$ vs $\leq$, but altogether the pseudocode is pretty easy
Pseudocode for list:
```python
# list of 10 nums
nums = sorted(list)
val_to_find = get_num()

low = 0
high = len(nums)

while low <= high:
    # 0 + (10 - 0) // 2 = 5 // 2 = 2
    mid = low + (high - low) // 2
    if check(val):
        low = mid + 1 # or low = mid
    else:
        high = mid - 1 # or high = mid
        

return(-1)
```

### Tree
In a binary search tree, there's some special properties where, for any Vertex V, it's right child is greater than it's value, and its left child is less than it's value

Ultimately it's just a way to restructure a Linked List so that search is in $O(\log n)$ time - this entire concept is the idea of [Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees](/docs/dsa/6.%20binary%20search/SELF_BALANCING.md) such as [B-Tree's](/docs/architecture_components/databases%20&%20storage/Disk%20Based/BTREE.md). Self balancing tree's have less efficient writes (since they need to find where to place nodes and do some restructuring), but the idea is that reads are much more efficient

A Binary Search Tree has similar code structure to Lists

```python
def search_bst(root, target):
    while root is not None:
        if root.val == target:
            return True
        elif target < root.val:
            root = root.left
        else:
            root = root.right
    return False
```
