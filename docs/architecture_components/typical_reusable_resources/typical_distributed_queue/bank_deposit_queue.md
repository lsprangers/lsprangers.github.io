# Bank Deposit Priority Queue
- This is an implementation of multiple requests being sent using timestamps that have withdraws, deposits, and cashback examples
- This is useful to showcase how priority queue's can be used in certain situations, such as using timestamps to balance accounts

## Setup
- balances: list of ints, 1-indexed
- requests: list of tuples (action, timestamp, account_id, amount)
- For a withdraw request, we need to process a cashback amount of 2% exactly 24 hours from the withdraw
- Timestamps are integer timestamps, may overlap


```python
import time

def now():
    return int(time.time())

def process_requests(balances, requests):
    # implement

def run_scenario(scenario_num, balances, requests, expected_balances, expected_results):
    try:
        final_balances, results = process_requests(list(balances), requests)
        balances_ok = final_balances == expected_balances
        results_ok = results == expected_results
        print(f"Scenario {scenario_num}: {'PASS' if balances_ok and results_ok else 'FAIL'}")
        if not balances_ok:
            print(f"  Expected balances: {expected_balances}, got: {final_balances}")
        if not results_ok:
            print(f"  Expected results: {expected_results}, got: {results}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Scenario {scenario_num}: ERROR - {e}")
