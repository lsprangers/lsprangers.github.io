# NoSQL
Basically taking away schemas, indexes, and transactions in favor of massively scaling some form of documents / K:V pairs

This doesn't begin to cover everything, as NoSQL can be Document, Wide Column, Graph, K:V, setc. (Not Only SQL), but in most peoples day-to-day NoSQL refers to K:V storage of some sorts

Some small implementations done for KV Stores such as [KV Store With Transactions](/docs/dsa/implementations/kv_store_with_transactions.md)
