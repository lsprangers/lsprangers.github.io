## Security
Security is all over the place, I don't know much about front-end, but do have enough experience with authentication and authorization in SaaS because of ML products that I plop this in here for those interviews

Authentication deals with figuring out who is making a request, and authorization figures out if that person, who is now authenticated, has the access to their requested resources

You can be authenticated without being authorized, but you can't be authorized without being authenticated

Talk about [Authentication](/docs/architecture_components/authentication%20flows/index.md) in another area, think it belongs over there
