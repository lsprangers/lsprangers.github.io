# ðŸ“š Tech Notes

Why this? I had this all in word docs when I was going through interviews, so figured I'd put it in here somewhere

It's a mix of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **System Design**, **Machine Learning concepts**, and more. 

It's a structured dump of stuff I've pulled out of old word files and tweaked into linkable artifacts

---

## Highlights
Some of the better displays on here:
- [Typical reusable resources](/docs/architecture_components/typical_reusable_resources/index.md) which are examples of architecture components built from ground up
  - In memory implementations
  - Distributed implementations
      - In memory node + some manager and scaling
- [Pregel Graph Processing](/docs/other_concepts/graph_processing/PREGEL.md) and how I've used it in large analytics based product companies
- [Video Recommendations](/docs/design_systems/video_recommendations/index.md) which showcases a specific example of what's talked about in [Generic Search Systems](/docs/design_systems/search_system/index.md)
- [Spark Notes](/docs/other_concepts/SPARK.md)
<!-- - [Delta Sharing Data Feeds](TODO) -->
<!-- - [High Throughput Ads Experimentation System] -->
- Outside of these it's mostly a dump of notes around DSA, Systems Design, Leetcode, and other junk

## Architecture and Systems Design Examples

This section focuses on building specific systems, often inspired by technical interviews or real-world use cases. Examples include URL shorteners, YouTube Search, Top K Heavy Hitters, and more.



## Architecture Components
To implement these systems, you'll find notes under Architecture Components about databases, messaging, calculations, and other essential components.

There's also an entire section on [Typical Resources](/docs/architecture_components/typical_reusable_resources/index.md) where we build all of the typical components from scratch such as:
- Distributed Key-Value Stores
  - Front-end Load Balancers with Metadata
  - Distributed Queues
  - Distribued Logging
  - etc..
- Some includes Kubernetes (K8s) and Terraform configurations to demonstrate how to create these systems natively

## Data Structures & Algorithms

This section contains:
- General Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Their implementations, time/space complexities, and use cases.

---

## Other Concepts

This section includes generic concepts that don't fit into DSA or System Design, such as:
- Parallel Training Designs.
- Pregel Graph Traversals.

These are useful but don't belong in the other categories.

---

## Implementations

A collection of generic implementations, including:
- A Key-Value Store with Transactions.
- A Balanced Binary Search Tree from Scratch.
- ML Feature Store Architecture Diagram.

---

## Leetcode

This is a dump of LC problems and comments

---

## Arxiv
These are just papers I've read marked up with highlighter - my old iPad died and brought these here

## References

These are some of the resources I frequently use and reference throughout this repo:

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com): Great for DSA and Systems Design problems. I probably used this the most.
  - [Segment Tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/a-recursive-approach-to-segment-trees-range-sum-queries-lazy-propagation/)
- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/): Amazing visual explanations for Linear Algebra, Probability, and Deep Neural Networks.
  - Highly recommend the [Attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc&vl=en) video for understanding Transformers.
  - Also I use their [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html) package for my own animations now
