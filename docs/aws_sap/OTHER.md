- Deliver a specific application to any computer without provisioning infrastructure
- Application delivered from within a web browser

### AWS Device Farm
- App testing service for mobile and web apps
- Test across real browsers and real phones
- Fully automated using framework
- Can remotely login to devices for debugging to figure out why it works on one OS and not the other!

### CICD
- Continuous Integration:
    - As new code is pushed, testing is automatically done via testing / build servers
    - Helps us to check code for errors or things that "worked on developers laptop"
    - Developer gets feedback quickly
- Continuous Delivery:
    - Ensure software can be released reliably whenever needed
    - Ensure deployment happens often and are quick
    - As build servers run in Continuous Integration, it can be released to a Deployment Server with specific tags and versions
- ***Code***: Github
- ***Build***: Github, Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild
- ***Test***: Github, AWS CodeBuild
- ***Deploy***: Many things here, all depends on where packages need to end up
    - AWS Beanstalk
    - Github
    - AWS CodeDeploy
- ***Provision***: EC2 Fleet, Spark cluster, K8's cluster, etc...
- ***Orchestrator***: Github Workflows, AWS CodePipeline

CodePipeline and GitHub have some integrations as well, usually use GitHub WebHooks into CodePipeline or a CodeStar pipeline to sync GitHub and CodePipeline

### CodeGuru
- ML powered services for code reviews and app performance recommendations
    - ***CodeGuru Reviewer***: Automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
    - ***CodeGuru Profilier***: Visibility / recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)
- Supports Java and Python
- Integrates with GitHub and CodePipeline as a whole

### Macie
- Data security and data privacy service
- Helped to identify and alert you to sensitive PII data
- Analyzes data in S3, and notifies Amazon EventBridge

### SES
- Simple Email Service
- API or SMTP server
- Outbound and Inbound (can receive replies)
- Provides stats like deliveries, bounces, feedback loop, email opened, etc...
- Supports DomainKeys Identified Mail and Sender Policy Frameworks
- Flexible IP deployment: shared, dedicated, and customer-owned IP's
- Send emails using your app using Console, API's, or SMTP
- Good for mass mail marketing, integrating with Personalize and EventBridge
- Configuration Sets:
    - Customize and analyze your email send events
    - Event destinations:
        - Kinesis Data Firehose: Receives metrics for each email (bounces, clicks, opens, etc)
            - Write into Data Analytics ot S3 (Athena can query S3 then)
        - SNS: For immediate feedback on bounce and complaint information
    - IP Pool Management: Use IP pools to send particular types of emails

### Pinpoint
- Scalable, 2-way (inbound and outbound) marketing communication service
- Supports emails, SMS, push, voice, and in-app messaging
- Billions of messages per day
- Use cases:
    - Running marketing campaigns by sending marketing, bulk, or transactional SMS messages

- How to use this compared to SNS vs SES?
    - SNS and SES we must manage all end users and content
    - Pinpoing allows us to do templating, delivery schedules, targeted segments, etc so it's just a specific implementation on top of these tools

### EC2 Image Builder
- Helps to automate creation of VM's or container images
- Automate creation, maintenance, and validation of EC2 AMI's
    - Can spin up an EC2 and automatically run specific tests if desired
- Can publish these AMI's to multiple regions and accounts
- Run on a schedule
- Builds and packages up everything onto an AMI
- CICD Flow (CodePipeline):
    - Build Code:
        - Github / Something
        - AWS CodeBuild
    - Build AMI
        - AWS CloudFormation
        - EC2 Image Builder
        - AMI!
    - Rollout
        - AWS CloudFormation

### IoT Core
- Internet of Things
- Network of internet connected devices that are able to collect and transfer data
- AWS IoT Core allows you to easily connect IOT devices to AWS cloud
- Serverless & secure
- Scales to billions of devices and trillions of messages
- Integrates with multiple AWS services
    - Lambda, Sagemaker, S3, Kinesis, etc
    - IoT Topics:
        - Ingest via MQTT protocol
        - Filter down with IoT Rules
        - Act with IoT Rules Actions
    - Integrate
        - Lots of them, focus on:
        - Kinesis Data Firehose
            - IoT Core sends MQTT, which is sent to Kinesis Firehose by way of IoT Core Rules Actions
            - Can use this to transform and send downstream for aggregation and analysis
- Build IoT apps that gather, process, analyze, and act upon data
