## AWS SAP
This section is around notes for AWS Solutions Architect Professional and Networking exams, which is just a ton of jargon and components tied together

Most of AWS is tough to understand because everything has some marketed name like "Route53" instead of just "DNS Service", and figuring out how those components tie together now requires a 2-3 week in-depth course

## Networking

Understanding how to tie things together in a secure, scalable way is most important
