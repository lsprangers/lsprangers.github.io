# Typical Frontend
This is one of the common components we'd use across products, and is comprised of a static name / IP for a load balancer and some services

## Architecture

## VIP 
Virtual IP (VIP) is an IP address not tied to a physical network interface
- On AWS we can think of Elastic IP for network load balancer
- Basically allows clients to connect to a single IP address

Requirements:
- Stable endpoint, whether it is IP address or URL
- Connects to a load balancer
- Load Balancer is then able to route requests

AWS:
- Network Load Balancer: Works on Layer 4 (IP address, port) routing 
    - Can assign NLB an Elastic IP (unchanging IP address) via the Network Interface of the NLB
        - If you see fit you can have some Route53 DNS resolution for `url.com` to that ElasticIP
    - Then for any service that spins up in AWS you'd need to make those services a target from NLB
        - ServiceA has IP 1.1.1
            - If a client goes to NLB:80 --forward_to--> 1.1.1:80
        - ServiceB has IP 1.1.2
            - If a client goes to NLB:90 --forward_to--> 1.1.2:80

- Application Load Balancer: 
    - Works on Layer 7:
        - (url.com/param1) with URL parameters
        - Headers
        - HTTP Parameters
    - ***Also helps us route to dynamically scaling ECS / EKS instances***
    - Route53 DNS record can map to ALB DNS name
        - `url.com` can route to `my-alb-123456.<region>.elb.amazon.com`
    - Similar to above, except we register services and instances instead of IP addresses
        - If a client goes to `url.com/register` --forward_to--> ECS registration service with 1:Many instances running
        - Still need to register port information that ECS containers would be listening to, along with ensuring security group routing rules
