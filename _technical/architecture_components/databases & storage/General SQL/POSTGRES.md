# Postgres
Postgres is, in my opinion, the most useful, used, and general purpose Open Source SQL Database on the market

There are certain scenarios where Postgres doesn't do its job well, but for most "run of the mill" scenarios Postgres will cover everything you need with great support and good documentation
