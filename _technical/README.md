# üìö This Repo

This repository is a collection of notes, implementations, and concepts I've gathered over time. 

It's a mix of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **System Design**, **Machine Learning concepts**, and more. 

Think of it as a structured dump of everything I've read and wanted to document outside of a Word file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Systems

This section focuses on building specific systems, often inspired by technical interviews or real-world use cases. Examples include URL shorteners, YouTube Search, Top K Heavy Hitters, and more.

To implement these systems, you'll find notes on Databases, Messaging, Calculations, and other essential components.

### üìÇ Databases and Storage
- Covers SQL and NoSQL architectures/products.
- Includes discussions on Relational Databases, NoSQL Key-Value Stores, Blob Storage, and Data Warehousing Solutions.

### üì© Messaging
- Explains how to send messages between services using Queues, Brokers, and Pub/Sub systems.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Resources
- Discussions and implementations of "typical" resources like:
  - Distributed Key-Value Stores.
  - Front-end Load Balancers with Metadata.
  - Distributed Queues.
- Includes Kubernetes (K8s) and Terraform configurations to demonstrate how to create these systems natively.

## üßÆ DSA

This section contains:
- General Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Their implementations, time/space complexities, and use cases.

---

## üí° Other Concepts

This section includes generic concepts that don't fit into DSA or System Design, such as:
- Embeddings.
- Parallel Training Designs.
- Pregel Graph Traversals.

These are useful but don't belong in the other categories.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementations

A collection of generic implementations, including:
- A Key-Value Store with Transactions.
- A Balanced Binary Search Tree from Scratch.
- ML Feature Store Architecture Diagram.

---

## üß© Leet

This is a dump of **Leetcode problems** and comments, organized for easy reference.

---

## üòÄ Arxiv
These are just papers I've read marked up with highlighter - my old iPad died and brought these here
