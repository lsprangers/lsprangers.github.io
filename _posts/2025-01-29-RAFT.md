title: "My Experience Creating A RAFT Cluster From Scratch"

### Setup
I took a [course](https://www.dabeaz.com/raft.html) recently with some work peers that was focused on recreating the RAFT consensus algorithm from scratch.

The course itself was taught by David Beazley, a professor at the University of Chicago.

The entire idea of the course was to fully recreate RAFT from scratch using nothing but the OS libraries included in a standard bundle:
- Sockets
- Threading
- Queueing

The main challenge, other than recreating this thing from scratch, was creating a fully functioning test suite along with trying to have some sort of production setting with DNS and networking.
